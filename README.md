# Purpose
<br>
Working in schools, during the Covid19 pandemic, gave me a unique insight into the challenges that teachers, parents and pupils all faced with regards to remote learning. Whilst many companies were quick to meet the demands of schools, many of these products were focussed on satisfying larger audiences and were rarely bespoke for each individual school and their needs. These websites offered libraries of generic resources, but lacked a sense of community, professional dialogue, and the ability to rapidly change the resources on offer to suit pupils' needs. 

With the Home Learning Hub, my goal has been to create an online learning platform which serves as a 'hub' for the teachers, parents and pupils of a specific school. It was clear from recent years that the profession has needed to rapidly adapt and re-evaluate how we can positivly affect change in pupil's lives, and that the process of 'home-learning' should not only be resigned to extreme circumstances, but instead be used as an on-going tool. My goal would be for The Home Learning Hub to not only support the education of pupils but also: enhance pupil wellbeing, provide efficient communication betwen school and home, boost parent confidence, and continue to instil a sense of 'school community'.


# User Experience
<br>
## Objective of Project:
<br>
1. To produce the **MVP** (minimum viable product), that allows `users` (parents) to interact with admins (teachers) by booking consultation appointments and accessing a 'resource library' populated by the child's school.
2. To enable users to access the booking process and the resource library with ease and without the requirement of supplying credentials.
3. To allow admins (teachers) to register and access authorised areas of the site - including the ability to manage appointments and upload resources to the library.



## Target Audience
<br>
The main target audiences for the site are parents and teachers. The website needed to be functional for both of these user groups and their different needs.

### Parents (users) needs:
- **Simple design** - focussing on being a welcoming space whilst not detracting from the main purpose of the site.
- **Accessibility** - simple navigation, supported by minimal user steps to accomplish goals.
- **Communication** - clear and present feedback to reassure the user of their actions and success with achieving goals.

### Teachers (admins) needs:
- **Unique Access** - authorisation present to open up restricted pages dedicated to managing data and admin privaleges.
- **Functionality** - the managing of appointments and the uploading of resources needs to be simple, quick and fit-for-purpose.
- **Defensive Measures** - any edits or deletions are met with additional checks to ensure data is not accidentally altered.

## Functionality Requirements

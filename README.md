<h1 align="center">The Home Learning Hub</h1>

# Purpose
Working in schools, during the Covid19 pandemic, gave me a unique insight into the challenges that teachers, parents and pupils all faced with regards to remote learning. Whilst many companies were quick to meet the demands of schools, many of these products were focussed on satisfying larger audiences and were rarely bespoke for each individual school and their needs. These websites offered libraries of generic resources, but lacked a sense of community, professional dialogue, and the ability to rapidly change the resources on offer to suit pupils' needs. 

With the Home Learning Hub, my goal has been to create an online learning platform which serves as a 'hub' for the teachers, parents and pupils of a specific school. It was clear from recent years that the profession has needed to rapidly adapt and re-evaluate how we can positivly affect change in pupil's lives, and that the process of 'home-learning' should not only be resigned to extreme circumstances, but instead be used as an on-going tool. My goal would be for The Home Learning Hub to not only support the education of pupils but also: enhance pupil wellbeing, provide efficient communication betwen school and home, boost parent confidence, and continue to instil a sense of 'school community'.

Some of the main features/functions of the platform include:
-   __A Resource Library__
-   __A Parent/Teacher Consultation Booking System__
-   __A Shared Message Board__
